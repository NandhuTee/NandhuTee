👋 Hi, I’m Nandhini (@NandhuTee), a passionate Full Stack Developer with a solid academic background (MCA & MTech). I have experience as an Industrial Trainer and Assistant Professor, and I'm now focused on mastering both front-end and back-end technologies.

I gained hands-on experience in Reactjs ,Node.js and the MERN stack through structured training at Newton School and Edu Pi School(2023-2025). During my learning, I completed several guided and independent projects, including:

🧳 EaseMyTrip Clone – Full-stack project using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Implemented features like user login, flight/hotel booking, and search filters.

🐦 Twitter Clone – Created with React and Node.js, focusing on backend routes, authentication, and post management using MongoDB.

🎯 Completed multiple tasks involving API creation, RESTful routes, and integrating frontend with backend logic.

These experiences strengthened my practical understanding of both frontend (React) and backend (Node/Express/MongoDB) development. I’m confident in building scalable web applications using the MERN stack.

Open to collaboration on innovative projects!
