👋 Hi, I’m Nandhini (@NandhuTee) — a passionate Full Stack Developer with a strong academic foundation (MCA & MTech).
With experience as an Industrial Trainer and Assistant Professor, I’m now focused on mastering frontend and backend technologies to build impactful web applications.

🌱 Currently:

Revising the Full Stack Developer course on freeCodeCamp

Working as a Web Developer Intern

Enhancing my skills in React, Node.js, and MongoDB

💡 Learning & Sharing:
I actively engage in the Reactiflux Discord community and contribute blogs on Dev.to.
I’ve also started a YouTube channel where I post short tutorials and explain web development concepts in an easy-to-understand way.

💬 Ask me about: React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, REST APIs
🤝 Open to: Collaborations on innovative projects, internships, and open-source contributions
⚡ Fun fact: I spend about 1 hour daily exploring new technologies, creating content, and helping others learn — it keeps me motivated and creative!
